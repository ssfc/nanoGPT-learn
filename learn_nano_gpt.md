# Learn nanoGPT

### Q: Is there any smaller transformer models (or GPT models) that are suitable for personal developers and learners?

There are some smaller transformer models (or GPT models) that are suitable for personal developers and learners. One approach is to prune parts of the network after training, such as removing some attention heads or layers, to reduce the size and speed up the inference of the models. For example, Poor Man's BERT: Smaller and Faster Transformer ModelsÂ¹Â² is a paper that explores a number of memory-light model reduction strategies that do not require model pre-training from scratch. The paper shows that they are able to prune BERT, RoBERTa and XLNet models by up to 40%, while maintaining up to 98% of their original performance. They also show that their pruned models are on par with DistilBERT in terms of both model size and performance.

Another approach is to use a simpler architecture that still leverages the power of attention, such as the Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) or the Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020). These models use techniques such as recurrence, relative positional encoding, reversible layers, and locality-sensitive hashing to reduce the memory and computational cost of the transformer models.

### Q: introduce nanoGPT

nanoGPT is a project by Andrej Karpathy that aims to provide the simplest, fastest repository for training/finetuning medium-sized GPTsÂ¹. It is a rewrite of minGPT that prioritizes teeth over education, meaning that it focuses on getting good results with minimal code and complexity. nanoGPT can reproduce GPT-2 (124M) on OpenWebText, running on a single 8XA100 40GB node in about 4 days of trainingÂ¹. The code itself is very simple and readable: train.py is a ~300-line boilerplate training loop and model.py a ~300-line GPT model definition, which can optionally load the GPT-2 weights from OpenAIÂ¹.

nanoGPT is a great tool for personal developers and learners who want to experiment with GPT models without spending too much time and resources on setting up the environment and training the models. nanoGPT also allows you to easily customize the model size, data, and hyperparameters to suit your needs. You can use nanoGPT to train your own language model on any text corpus, such as Shakespeare's works, song lyrics, or your own writing. You can also finetune pretrained checkpoints from OpenAI or other sources to adapt them to your specific domain or taskÂ¹.

If you want to learn more about nanoGPT and how to use it, you can check out this blog post by Sophia Yang: Train your own language model with nanoGPTÂ². It gives a step-by-step tutorial on how to train a songwriter using nanoGPT. You can also watch this video by Andrej Karpathy himself: Build ChatGPT from ScratchÂ³. It shows how to build a chatbot using nanoGPT in less than an hour.

I hope this gives you a good overview of nanoGPT and its potential applications. Do you have any other questions? ðŸ˜Š
