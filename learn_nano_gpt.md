### Q: Is there any smaller transformer models (or GPT models) that are suitable for personal developers and learners?

There are some smaller transformer models (or GPT models) that are suitable for personal developers and learners. One approach is to prune parts of the network after training, such as removing some attention heads or layers, to reduce the size and speed up the inference of the models. For example, Poor Man's BERT: Smaller and Faster Transformer ModelsÂ¹Â² is a paper that explores a number of memory-light model reduction strategies that do not require model pre-training from scratch. The paper shows that they are able to prune BERT, RoBERTa and XLNet models by up to 40%, while maintaining up to 98% of their original performance. They also show that their pruned models are on par with DistilBERT in terms of both model size and performance.

Another approach is to use a simpler architecture that still leverages the power of attention, such as the Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) or the Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020). These models use techniques such as recurrence, relative positional encoding, reversible layers, and locality-sensitive hashing to reduce the memory and computational cost of the transformer models.
